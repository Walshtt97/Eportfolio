                    Welcome to my E-Portfolio! I am in my last year at the University 
                    of Cincinnati (UC). I am currently seeking a Bachelors of 
                    Engineering in Computer Science and a Minor in Mathematics. 
                    I plan to graduate in the spring of 2020. Through my Cooperative 
                    Education program I have gained experience in many areas, but 
                    I am especially happy with all it has taught me about web design 
                    and application design.
                    <br></br>
                    <br></br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                    Outside of academics I try to stay connected to involve myself 
                    with several different campus organizations and charitable groups. 
                    I held executive offices in both my Fraternity and the Rugby 
                    Club on campus.
                    <br></br>

                    Thank you for viewing my portfolio! I hope you enjoy learning 
                    more about my engagements and experiences.Â <b>Please Take a
